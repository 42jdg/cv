## ‚å® Technical Experience

**Software Engineer** @ [Boyum-IT](https://www.boyum-it.com) (Jan 2016 - present)

* Creation of an internal application (PHP) to create reports and display a [public activity log](https://www.beascloud.com/beasweb/tfsActivityLog.php) from data collected directly from our Azure TFS using TFS API and a custom gateway for the pictures extracted from Azure
* Taking requirements, analysis, and development of a new framework to rebuild the old terminal application with the cloud as the target from scratch. Some of the main challenges have been:
* * Refactoring of legacy code to allow integration without code duplication
* * APIfication of core elements to optimize communications between the core of the application and the new web modules exposing services throw an API/REST service
* * Creation of a new vanilla JS front end framework (due to the initial requirements, memory, and resources limitation, I created the framework from scratch with zero dependencies and low resources requirements focusing on handheld devices)

**Software Engineer** @ [Inform√°tica D.J. programadores](https://www.infdj.com) (1999 - 2016)

* * Integration with the Amazon APIs to automate received orders (any purchase made by an AMAZON customer triggered all the flow into the internal application, reserving the products, creating the sales documents, updating the stock in the ecommerce/amazon/PoS, etc..)
* * Integration of Amazon APIs to publish and update products, using an adaptive algorithm to increase / decrease prices based on offers from other sellers.
* * Integration with the providers APIs to keep updating the prices and products
